# Sweap API in Go

This is a community-maintained implementation for the Sweap REST API in Golang

This library supports most if not all of the api.sweap.io REST calls.

## Project Status

There is currently no major version released. Therefore, minor version releases may include backward incompatible changes.

See CHANGELOG.md or Releases for more information about the changes.

## Original Documentation

The official documentation of the REST API can be found at <https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5746225/UVBzmp2n#defe4351-fb75-4d87-a73f-b9e8f0d843c2>

## Postman Collection

In addition to this golang we maintain a Postman collection for interacting with the REST API with Postman <https://www.postman.com/getsweap>
